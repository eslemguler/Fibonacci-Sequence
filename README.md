# Fibonacci-Sequence
Java Lecture Homework-1

This is my Java Lecture's 1st homework. The rules are"

The application will be run from console (terminal) and will be executable in two modes:
• With one integer parameter n, the application will print the first n members of Fibonacci sequence.
Example run:

$ java ijae1.xmatya05.TestFib 5
0 1 1 2 3
$ java ijae1.xmatya05.TestFib 10
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

• With three integer parameters seed1, seed2, n – the application prints the first n members of Fibonacci
sequence with seeds F1 = seed1 and F2 = seed2. Remember that seed1 < seed2.
$ java ijae1.xmatya05.TestFib 8 13 5
8 13 21 34 55
$ java ijae1.xmatya05.TestFib 10 20 6
10 20 30 50 80 130
